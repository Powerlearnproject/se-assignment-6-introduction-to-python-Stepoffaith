2. Steps to install Python on Windows and set up a virtual environment:
Download Python for windows and choose between 32-bit or 64-bit. 
Run the Python Installer
Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.
   - Click on the "Install Now" button to start the installation process. 
Verify Python Installation
Open the Command Prompt by searching for "cmd" in the Windows search bar and clicking on the Command Prompt app.
Type `python --version` in the Command Prompt and press Enter. You should see the Python version number displayed, confirming that Python is successfully installed.
Set Up a Virtual Environment
install the virtualenv package by running `pip install virtualenv` in the Command Prompt.
Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project folder.
Run the command `virtualenv venv` to create a new virtual environment named "venv".

Float is Numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form.
Str is Sequences of characters enclosed in single, double, or quotes.
Booleans Represents True or False.
Lists: Ordered collections of items enclosed in square brackets.
Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections enclosed in parentheses.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces.
# Integers
my_int = 42

# Floating-point numbers
my_float = 3.14

# Strings
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Booleans
my_bool = True

# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Tuples
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}

# Print out the variables
print("Integer:", my_int)
print("Float:", my_float)
print("String:", my_string)
print("Boolean:", my_bool)
print("List:", my_list)
print("Tuple:", my_tuple)
print("Dictionary:", my_dict)
